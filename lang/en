CommitInfo3=3. Update system.conf and chan_dahdi_trunk.conf with the new configuration
CommitInfo4=4. Stop asterisk, reload the Dahdi drivers with the new configs and restart asterisk.
CommitInfo5=5. Display the Dahdi channels from the asterisk CLI if successful

CreatingConfig=Creating Dahdi Device Configurations
CreatingConfigGlobal=Global Configurations
CreatingConfigInfo=If the dahdi devices <i>have loaded</i> properly, then the configuration can proceed. This step will configure the Dahdi drivers and Asterisk files which will assign the function of the channels to the devices. The functions consist of FXS, FXO, BRI, PRI, E1, T1 and echo canceller parameters.  
CreatingConfigIntructions=You will be configuring each Dahdi devices separately according to the order that was displayed in the Checking for Dahdi Devices page. This is a brute force method for configuring Dahdi. You normally just have to configure Dahdi once and then it will run forever or until you do something stupid.
CreatingConfigNotes=You should have the printout of the <b>Checking for Dahdi Devices</b> page in order to make this as painless as possible. If you don't have it, this would be a good time to go back and print it out.. There is a link at the bottom of the page to take you back to the Checking for Dahdi Devices page
CreatingHWConfig=Creating Dahdi hardware configurations
CreatingHWConfigInfo=If the dahdi devices <i>have loaded</i> properly, then the configuration of the dahdi hardware devices can occur. This step will configure the /etc/dahdi/system.conf file which will assign the function of the channels to the devices. The functions consist of FXS, FXO, BRI, PRI and echo canceller parameters.  
CreatingSWConfig=Creating Asterisk/Dahdi software interface configurations
CreatingSWConfigInfo=This step will aid in creating the Asterisk (software) trunk configurations. This is specifically for FXO, BRI and PRI trunks to the PSTN. <p><B>Note:</b> FXS extensions are created through FreePBX.

DynamicInfo1=1. Dahdi allows you to create a single or multiple T1/E1 span(s) over Ethernet (TDMoE). This will work with or without a Dahdi card. If you don't have a Dahdi card installed, you will have to use the Dahdi dummy driver to generate the proper timing signals.
DynamicInfo2=2. You can create up to 8 dynamic Dahdi spans (equivalent to 8x E1/T1 lines) by selecting the number of subinterfaces. The PBX with the Dahdi card or dummy will provide Master Timing, the other will be Slave.
DynamicInfo3=3. Dynamic spans only work within a single local LAN. The devices are identified by MAC address. You must know the MAC address of your dynamic peer that you are connecting to.
Finished=Finished
FoundDevices=Checking for Dahdi devices
FoundDevicesExplanation=The bold line indicates the Dahdi compatible device found indicated by the Span number. The content displayed depends on the legacy card. E1/T1 and TDM cards may contain the computer bus used, the physical card number and the assigned span number. You can have multiple spans (physical ports) on one card (e.g. multiport T1/E1 card). Asterisk identifies ports/cards by the span number. Astribanks are identified by the USB port instead of the hardware bus. 
FoundDevicesInfo=Information about detected Dahdi devices will be displayed. This includes: driver name, card #, span #, card model, base dahdi channel, number of channels
FoundDevicesPrint=<B>Print</b> this page <b>now</b>. You will need it as a reference when you configure each device.
FoundDevicesReturn=Return to Checking for Dahdi devices
FoundDevicesWarning=<b>WARNING:</b> If you have an Astribank, OpenVOX or Sangoma card, the manufacturer's Dahdi compatible interface driver must be installed <B>before</b> configuring Dahdi. <br> <ul><li> - For the Astribank, it is the fxload and xpp_fxloader. Check to see if "/usr/share/dahdi/xpp_fxloader" exists<li> - For Sangoma, it is the WANpipe drivers - check to see if it is loaded by running the "wanrouter" command at the Linux command prompt. <li> - For OpenVOX, it is their proprietary drivers: "opvax" series. Run "lspci -vvv" at the Linux command prompt and look for a kernel driver like opvax24xx. <p>The Dahdi HW Config module <b>ONLY</b> configures the Dahdi interface to Asterisk which is common to all drivers.. It is up to <B>you</b> to install the manufacturer specific drivers correctly.
FXInstructions1=1. You can configure a range of channels or select individual channels. To select individual channels, the "to" value must be equal or less than the first number selected. The max channel number is 254 and only digits allowed.
FXInstructions2=2. The default echocanceller is mg2 (safe choice). If the card has a hardware echocanceller use "hwec". The software echocancellers "oslec" and "hpec" may need to be compiled into the kernel to be used.
FXInstructions3=3. The channels can be combined together to a form a group. By default, the Dahdi HW module combines the channels into groups that are numbered according to the span number. You can change the group number to one that fits your dialplan.
Go2Global=Last Step - Global Configuration
Go2Global2=When you are finished configuring <B>all</b> of your Dahdi devices, only then should you go to the last step - Global Configuration
Go2GlobalInfo=There are two settings for the Global configuraton to worry about. They are the loadzone and defaultzone settings based on your geographic location. They configure the tone generation patterns that the local telco uses. Normally, they are the same setting.
Go2GlobalComplete=Submit and Review
hw_message=These are the dahdi devices detected:
index_title=Dahdi HW Config
index_root=The root directory is $1.
ISDNinfo1=1. At this time, ISDN is the only configuration supported. The default configuration should work for most T1 installations in North America.
ISDNinfo2=2. E1 configurations are a little bit more tricky. Typically, E1 has bchan 1-15, dchan 16, bchan 17-31. 
ISDNinfo3=3. BRI uses bchan 1-2 and dchan 3. BRI can only accept 0 db for Line Build Out (LBO)

SystemModulesInfo=The file <b>/etc/dahdi/modules</b> configures the kernel Dahdi drivers that are loaded and the order of the loading. The order of loading is important if you have two or more <b>different</b> dahdi devices installed. The order of loading determines the channel number assignment.<P> If your dahdi devices are the same model, then the order of channels will be determined by the PCI slot that the device is installed in. Astribank USB devices are loaded depending on the order of the USB device. <P> You cannot separate modules, for example: You cannot load a TDM400 then an Astribank then a second TDM400. The two TDM400 cards will load first then the Astribank. Or the Astribank will load first then the two TDM400 cards.
